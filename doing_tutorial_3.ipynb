The most important difference is the composition for metabolites and gene associations for reactions. Metabolite composition information is useful for finding errors in the GEMs and knowing gene associations allows to link the GEMs to other types of data, such as microarrays.\n",
    "By default, the production of acetate, biomass, glycerol, CO2, and ethanol is allowed and the consumption of O2 and glucose is not allowed. Try to validate the model by confirming the results from Tutorial 2 (the maximal ATP production in glycolysis). One can set the simulation parameters in the Excel file like in Tutorial 2 or try to use the setParam function instead (see tutorial3.m). Just remember that sucrose was used in the first example while glucose is used here."
