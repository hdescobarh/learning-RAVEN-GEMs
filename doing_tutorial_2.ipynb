    "This is a particularly important warning, which must be correctly understood before moving on. Since the modelling is done under the steady state assumption, the production rate of a given metabolite must be the same as the consumption rate. But what if there are no reactions consuming or no reactions producing a given metabolite? Then the production/consumption rate must be zero, which is not a desirable result. The warning simply lists metabolites that only participate in one reaction, which means that it either cannot be consumed or that it cannot be produced. The fact that the warning says, “internal metabolites” indicates that this is not the only kind of metabolite and the solution may lie in something we call “external metabolites”. These are metabolites which do not have to be mass balanced but can be produced or consumed in any amount. Simulations are often centred on choosing which external metabolites are available and how fast they can be produced or consumed by the GEM. External metabolites are defined by having “true” in the “UNCONSTRAINED” field in the “METS” sheet. They are also by convention placed in a compartment abbreviated “b”, referred as “boundary”. These metabolites are also called “exchange metabolites” and the reactions involving them are called “exchange reactions”.\n"

    "5.\tIn the case for glycolysis, it is essential to allow for uptake of sucrose and production of pyruvate. At this point maybe it is not clear whether there will be net consumption or net synthesis of water, so one should make that exchange reaction reversible. The reaction for taking up sucrose would look like “sucrose[b] => sucrose[e]”. Add the required reactions for sucrose, pyruvate and H2O. Usually, it is only allowed for uptake/excretion from the “extracellular” compartment so add transport reactions when needed. The warning should now read:\n",

    "6.\tAll the “real” reactions involved in glycolysis have been added to the GEM. However, to be able to answer the question about the ATP production one should address the two remaining problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; a. How does one get the required NAD+ and how does one get rid of the produced NADH?\n",
    "\n",
    "&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; b. How does one formulate the ATP production as a variable one can solve for?\n",
    "\n",
    "7.\tThe first problem could be solved either by expanding the model to contain a larger proportion of metabolism so that the model has a way to regenerate NAD+ from NADH or by including a “fake” uptake reaction for NAD+ and a “fake” excretion reaction for NADH. These reactions are called “fake” because they are not how the system works in vivo (the cell does not take up extracellular NAD+ and so on…). The use of fake reactions is common in this type of modelling and cleverly designing fake reactions can help a lot when doing simulations. Choose either to deal with the problem by including ethanol production from pyruvate (via pyruvate decarboxylase + alcohol dehydrogenase) or by including fake exchange reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.\tThe second problem also requires fake reactions. Remember that the variables that are solved for are fluxes through reactions. One way to know how much ATP the system can generate is to maximize for the degradation of ATP (since the production and consumption must match). Add a fake reaction for hydrolysis of ATP. Be careful about directionality so that the free ATP synthesis is not added instead. Upon completion, one should see no warnings when running importExcelModel.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.\tThe GEM is now complete and can finally be used to answer the question about the ATP production. In the GEM modelling the problem is defined by (a) setting constraints on the fluxes and (b) defining an objective for the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.\tAn usual modelling practice is to set constraints only for the exchange reactions; the things that the GEM can consume and produce. In this case it is enough to constrain the uptake of sucrose. Set the “UPPER BOUND” for that reaction to 1.0 unit. Once talking about the fluxes, the units are mmol/gDW/h, but when one looks at yields, one might as well think of them as mol or “molecules”. Set the objective to maximize ATP degradation by putting 1 in the “OBJECTIVE” column for that reaction.\n",

    "11.\tImport the model to MATLAB by running importExcelModel. One should see that the model structure is printed. Select the name “smallModel” from the MATLAB “Workspace” section and double click it with left mouse button (or just write “open smallModel”). Click around a little bit and try to figure out what the different fields stand for.\n",
