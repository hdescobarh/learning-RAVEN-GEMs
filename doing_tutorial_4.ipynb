    "# Tutorial 4 ‚Äì Fix an Erroneous Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole point of GEMs is that they are large. It is by incorporating the entire known metabolism of any given organism that complexity arises. However, this makes it almost certain that all models will contain errors. This is true regardless of whether one builds the model or if one uses a model from someone else. One of the issues is that if one group publishes a model for some specific purpose it is likely to function well in that specific part of metabolism, but it may not function at all for some problems. It is therefore a good idea to perform a round of error checking even if it is a published model one uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model validation is an iterative process because some errors might not have an effect until some other errors have been fixed. It is not uncommon that the model ‚Äúworks‚Äù well in the beginning of the reconstruction process because there are errors that let it cheat on things like redox or energy balance. The model then works worse and worse as the errors are dealt with until all or most errors are fixed, after which it will start to work again. As RAVEN developers, we believe that it is much more important to try to make the model do something it should not be allowed to do rather than to test for the stuff it should do.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a version of the small yeast model with errors inserted (smallYeastBad.xlsx). The task for this exercise is to find and fix them. Some errors will be obvious (it is rather difficult to introduce errors in such a small model, because there is extraordinarily little redundancy in it), but it is strongly recommended not to fix them until they are ‚Äúfound‚Äù during the following steps, because otherwise one might get unpredictable results. Most of the stuff done here can be done with the gapReport function, but it is strongly recommended to do them step by step. "

Maybe it costs energy or redox power for example. Or maybe the necessary reactions are in different compartments. It is generally a good idea to relax as many constraints as possible when searching for errors. For instance, one can include a temporary reaction like ‚ÄúATP + H2O ‚áî ADP + Pi‚Äù and similar reactions with NADH and NADPH.

    "4.\tIn GEMs it is normal to have excretion of only a few metabolites while having very many internal metabolites. A common case is that one has an error that would like to produce something from nothing, but to do so it also must produce some other metabolite for which there is no exchange reaction. A convenient way to test this is to allow all metabolites to be excreted. One can do this by changing the model.b structure. Normally it is always a vector of zeros, but if one adds a second column RAVEN will interpret it as lower and upper bound on the equality constraints. So if one puts model.b=[model.b inf(numel(model.b),1)]; one can now excrete anything. Do this and see if the model can produce anything. For instance, one should get ethanol, glycerol, and CO2. Look at the fluxes and find the error. One can get a clue by looking at the warnings from SBMLFromExcel. Since this is a problem that comes from reactions being unbalanced, the problematic ones must be in one of the warnings. Which was the metabolite that had to be excreted for the error to appear? Do this step two times to find both errors.\n",

    "6.\tUnbalanced reactions are a relatively small problem, since they are so easy to find. A much bigger problem is when metabolites are named differently even though they are meant to be the same. Use smallYeastBad2.xlsx from here on. A first check is to see which reactions can carry flux when one allows for all uptakes and outputs of exchange metabolites. There are several ways to check this but use the function simplifyModel here. The primary purpose of this function is to remove unnecessary stuff from a model to make it smaller, but since it removes ‚Äúbad‚Äù reactions one can use it for error identification as well. If one runs it like it is in tutorial4.m one will see that there are about 20 metabolites and reactions that are dead ends. That is quite a lot, so take a look at the warnings from importExcelModel and see if it is possible to catch the obvious spelling error.\n",

Since there is no net synthesis of co-factors in this small model those are not interesting (coenzyme A or ATP are not synthesized from glucose). One should look at the top one that is not a co-factor. This one is a bit tricky, and one might want to look it up in KEGG.\n",
